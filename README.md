## Introduction

The Clean Architecture Folder Template is a starting point for building .NET applications using the Clean Architecture principles. By following this template, you can structure your codebase in a way that facilitates easy understanding, maintenance, and extensibility.

## Features

- Well-organized folder structure based on Clean Architecture principles
- Separation of concerns and clear boundaries between layers
- Easy navigation and location of specific components
- Enhances code readability and maintainability
- Supports testability and scalability
- Provides a foundation for building complex applications

## Requirements

To use this template, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or higher)

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the Clean Architecture Folder Template:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yunuskiran/CleanArchitectureFolderTemplate.git
## Usage

The Clean Architecture Folder Template provides a foundation for structuring your project. You can customize the template to suit your specific needs. Here are some guidelines for using this template effectively:

1. Review the existing folder structure and familiarize yourself with the Clean Architecture principles.
2. Replace or modify the sample files with your own application-specific code.
3. Add or remove folders as needed to match your project requirements.
4. Build and run your application using the provided build scripts.

### Folder Structure

The folder structure of the template follows the Clean Architecture principles. Here's an overview of the main folders:

- `src`: Contains the source code of your application. This is where you'll find the core business logic.

Feel free to modify the folder structure according to your project's needs. However, ensure that you maintain the separation of concerns and follow the Clean Architecture principles.

### Building and Running the Application

To build and run your application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Build the application using the following command:

   ```shell
   dotnet build
## Customization

Feel free to customize the template to fit your specific project requirements. You can add additional folders, modify existing files, or include any other frameworks or libraries you need. Remember to maintain the separation of concerns and adhere to the Clean Architecture principles.

To customize the template, follow these steps:

1. Review the existing folder structure and familiarize yourself with the Clean Architecture principles.
2. Add or remove folders as needed to match your project requirements.
3. Modify or replace the sample files with your own application-specific code.
4. Include any additional frameworks or libraries by following the appropriate installation and configuration steps.

Make sure to maintain the separation of concerns and follow the Clean Architecture principles to ensure the maintainability and testability of your codebase.
